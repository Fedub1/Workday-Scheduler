# Employee Tracker

# Installation 

For this project, I created a workday scheduler using standard business hours. This application allows users to input and save tasks in past, present, and future color coded timeblocks.

Instructions
Develop a work day schedule that shows standard business hours in one hour timeblocks.

Display timeblocks in color codes to represent past, present and future time.

Create input field for each time block and include save button so users can save text to local storage.

This project utilizes Bootstrap, moment.js and Jquery
